# RFindUnit - Version 1.0.7

Find unit (find uses) is a very simple tool and very used (Ctrl+Shift+A), but, as you know Delphi Find Unit doesn't work very well, in general it crashes or it's very slow.
</br>Currently it have the basics expected features, and I'm working to organize, optmize and give it new functions (as auto import for example).
If you help, it'll be very good.

### How does it work in practice ?
