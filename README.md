# RFindUnit

Find unit (find uses) is a very simple tool and very used (Ctrl+Shift+A), but, as you know Delphi Find Unit doesn't work very well, in general it crashes or it's very slow.
</br>Currently it have the basics expected features, and I'm working to organize, optmize and give it new functions (as auto import for example).
If you help, it'll be very good.

## Delphi Version
It requires Delphi XE or above.

### Instalation
**Delphi XE**: Download [the project](https://github.com/rfrezino/RFindUnit/archive/master.zip), unzip and run Installer.exe.
</br>**Other versions**: The installer identify all Delphi's Version, and will try to install in every one you ask for. But, as I just have Delphi XE, I just tried to compile to it. Certanly, you will not spend too much time, even it's necessary to add some compilation flag on the project. I'll work on the compability issue soon.
