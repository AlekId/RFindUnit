# RFindUnit

Find unit (find uses) is a very simple tool and very used (Ctrl+Shift+A), but, as you know Delphi Find Unit doesn't work very well, In general it creshes or it's very slow.
</br>I gave up of waiting for Delphi's team solve the problem and I decided to create this project to replace the Delphi's Find Unit default.
Currently it have the basics expected features, and I'm working to organize, optmize and give it new functions. 
If you help, it'll be very good.

## Delphi Version
It requires Delphi XE or above.

### Instalation
**Delphi XE**: Download [ReplaceFindUnit.zip](http://1drv.ms/1SKw2wN) 
</br>**Other versions**: I didn't create installer for every version. You can get the source code, and install it normaly. Just remember to add the "Thirdy" directory to library path.
</br>If you have access to another Delphi Version and can send me the BPL I can add on the installer.
